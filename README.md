Customer Churn Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project aims to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave) a telecom company using logistic regression, a popular classification algorithm. Churn prediction helps businesses reduce customer loss and improve satisfaction by proactively identifying at-risk users.

📁 Project Overview
✅ Binary Classification: Predict if a customer will churn (Yes/No)

🔍 Model Used: Logistic Regression

📊 Dataset: Simulated or from Kaggle's Telco Customer Churn Dataset

🧹 Techniques: EDA, feature engineering, model evaluation

📈 Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC AUC

🛠 Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

🧠 Workflow
